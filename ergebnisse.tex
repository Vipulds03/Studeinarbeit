\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:ergebnisse}
This chapter explores the results obtained from simulations using greedy algorithms, considering scenarios with and without tasking. It also looks into the effects of various weighting schemes discussed in earlier chapters. The simulations produce output files named detections, tracklets, and ephemerides, 
containing essential details like detection ID, fabricated NORAD ID, epoch, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), orbital elements, and other relevant information. The figures and findings presented in this chapter are based on the data extracted from these output files, providing a detailed analysis of algorithmic 
performance, the impact of tasking, and the influence of different weighting schemes.\\
